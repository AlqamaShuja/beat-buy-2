      "Get fuss-free access to Gaudí’s famous Barcelona park and a handy audio guide\nWant to see the most flamboyant and famous park in Barcelona? Get your hands on these Park Güell tickets and explore the Park Güell Monumental Zone at your leisure with an included audio guide.\n\nThis colorful park perched high on the hills was named after Count Eusebi Güell – and originally intended as a gated community for the city's well-to-do. It was opened to everyone when Gaudí passed away in 1926, and at that point the architect himself had called it home for the last 20 years.\n\nIt gets even more fanciful inside the Park Güell Monumental Zone. Man-made walls, roads, and walkways mimic natural forms. Exuberant buildings, colorful tile work, and the amazing snaking Serpent Bench all beg for you to take a photo. And the views of Barcelona from up high are like no other!\n\nPark Güell tickets will immerse you in Gaudí's one-of-a-kind imagination, and it's bound to inspire yours, too.\n\nWhats included:\n* Entry ticket to Park Güell\n* Downloadable audio guide\n\nWhats excluded:\n* Casa Gaudí Museum",
